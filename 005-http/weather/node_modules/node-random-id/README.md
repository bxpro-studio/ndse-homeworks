Very simple plugin for random adjective-noun ids like appear.in

```javascript
var randomid = require('node-random-id')

randomid.id(firstnumber, secondnumber, char)
```

This allows you to get an id from two numbers (adjectve and noun) and have a charcter inbetween.
I recommend either a hyphen '-' or a space ' ' depending on how it is going to be used

Or

```javascript
var randomid = require('node-random-id')

randomid.ranid()
```

This just gives you a random (adjective-noun) id with a hyphen in between
